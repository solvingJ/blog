title: Why Develop Software?
published: true
---
A few years ago, I started the challenging transition from a career as an experienced IT professional to a more junior software developer.  Many people have asked why, so I thought I'd start a blog post with some thoughts about Software Development as a career and hobby in general. 

### Fulfilling a Need

I believe it's important for the human mind to "create". Even those who don't think they're "creative" can't resist this urge.  This is clearly evidenced by the proliferation of paper airplanes and footballs in schools, gardens in backyards, and entire worlds in Minecraft. On a personal level, when I started working with computers, I quickly became addicted to helping people by solving their technical problems. When designing and building complex network and server environments, there was a fair amount of creation and problem solving.  However, after a project where I was forced wade a little deeper into the waters of software development, I could see that the opportunities to create and solve problems were vast in comparison to IT. Also, there were problems in IT for which there were no good solutions, and which I felt I could solve some day with software. 

### My Advice for Would-Be Developers
If you enjoy working with technology, then I encourage you to ignore the apparent overwhelming complexity that exists on the face of software development, and try your hand. For those who know they want to become developers, but aren't confident in their abilities, do not be discouraged. Despite being a natural technologist, I was NOT a natural developer.  Perhaps it was because I started later in life, but I continue to have to wrestle with new concepts for months before actually being able to read or write an example (even simple ones). I think I would have been discouraged, if not so stubborn... so be stubborn. 

### Realistic Expectations
It's also important to realize that even if you get into the field as a professional, you may decide that you do not enjoy or accept the lifestyle of a software developer.  However, this is true for almost any professional field.  Unfortunately, the fields of higher learning such as science, engineering, medicine, law, and others do not lend themselves to young people trying to choose a career path or major in college.  However, among these fields, software development is a bit of an exception because people can try it out while they are still young (although it does typically requires significant guidance and mentoring). 

### Summary
The transition to a career in software development has been a rewarding one for me, and I do recommend it. "Right now" seems like the most exciting and inspiring time one could possibly hope to be creating software. However, perhaps what excites me most is the knowledge that today's possibilities are almost certain to be dwarfed by those of tomorrow.
