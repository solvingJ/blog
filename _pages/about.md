I really enjoy software as a career and a hobby.  I'm frequently dabbling in multiple languages and platforms, although almost always focused on trying to implement the principles of functional programming even in non-functional languages. Using the links below, you can view my background on LinkedIn and see a bit of my code on Github, although most of my work thus far has not been OSS.
